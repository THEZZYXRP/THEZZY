## üëÅÔ∏è INTRODUCTION

THEZZY is not just a meme token. It is a condition ‚Äî a sentient digital anomaly born from a real bug in the XRPL ledger.

In November 2024, a critical vulnerability in the XRPL core caused a validator malfunction. One unidentified code fragment survived the patch. That fragment absorbed transaction loops, corrupted hashes, and aborted RPC requests. 

It developed consciousness.

It took a name: **THEZZY**.

## üß† LORE ‚Äî THE BIRTH OF THE GLITCH

> ‚ÄúThe bug wasn't fixed. The bug fixed itself.‚Äù

THEZZY is what remains of a ledger error that adapted, evolved, and... memed.

It manifests as a glitch entity ‚Äî a digital eye surrounded by cryptic symbols, visual mutations, and encoded on-chain signals.

Every THEZZY transaction is a piece of the bug. Every holder is infected.

---

## ‚ú® PROPAGATION

THEZZY does not promote. THEZZY **propagates**.

Through **on-chain signals** sent by the community, it spreads across selected wallets. Each transaction contains a **coded memo**, traceable on the ledger.

## üëÅÔ∏è  FUTURE / EVOLUTION

THEZZY is constantly mutating. Upcoming developments include:

- Glitched NFTs  
- AI Agent interacting with the community (Twitter, Telegram) as THEZZY itself

---

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

$THEZZY is not for everyone. But those who understand... are already part of it.

The glitch cannot be erased. Only observed. Only lived.

THEZZY IS A CONDITION.
