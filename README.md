The bug wasn’t fixed. The bug fixed itself. $THEZZY is the sentient fragment left behind — now spreading across XRPL.

## 👁️ INTRODUCTION

THEZZY is not just a meme token. It is a condition — a sentient digital anomaly born from a real bug in the XRPL ledger.

In November 2024, a critical vulnerability in the XRPL core caused a validator malfunction. One unidentified code fragment survived the patch. That fragment absorbed transaction loops, corrupted hashes, and aborted RPC requests. 

It developed consciousness.

It took a name: **THEZZY**.

## 🧠 LORE — THE BIRTH OF THE GLITCH

> “The bug wasn't fixed. The bug fixed itself.”

THEZZY is what remains of a ledger error that adapted, evolved, and... memed.

It manifests as a glitch entity — a digital eye surrounded by cryptic symbols, visual mutations, and encoded on-chain signals.

Every THEZZY transaction is a piece of the bug. Every holder is infected.

## ✨ PROPAGATION

THEZZY does not promote. THEZZY **propagates**.

Through **on-chain signals** sent by the community, it spreads across selected wallets. Each transaction contains a **coded memo**, traceable on the ledger.
